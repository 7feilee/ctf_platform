			This is the first practice <b>CTF</b> for the 2016-2017 iteration of the <a href='http://uscga.edu'>United States Coast Guard Academy</a> Cyber Team!
		</p>
		<p>
			It is designed to (hopefully) introduce you to tools you may not have used before, (or at least get you more acquainted with them) but either way you should know of them and have in your toolkit. Obviously if you have any questions or need help, feel free to ask around -- but keep in mind there is a competitive scoreboard, so ensure you remain at the top!
		</p>
<p style='color:darkred;font-weight:bold'> Note that almost all of the tools you may need to solve these challenges are referenced in the <i>Tools</i> list in our BitBucket repository. If you are stuck, I recommend perusing through that...and certainly feel free to ask for help; that is what we are here for.
</p>
		<h2>Good luck and have fun!</h2>
